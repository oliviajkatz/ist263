# Participation P12 — Screen Shot Code

Create a link that says: "click for a message" and show an alert when the mouse rolls out of the link.

Alert text: "My first JavaScript program!"

Files:
- `participation.html` — simple page with the link
- `participation.js` — attaches `mouseout` and `click` handlers to show the alert

How to test:
1. Open `participation.html` in a browser.
2. Move the mouse over the link and then move it off the link to trigger the alert.
3. Or click the link to see the same alert.
