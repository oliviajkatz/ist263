            <h1>About Olivia Katz</h1>
            <p>My name is Olivia Jane Katz. I am currently a Junior at Syracuse University studying Communication and Rhetorical Studies with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am interested in studying communication and how it benefits everyday work, which will guide me in the future.</p>
            <p>I hope to pursue a career in Public Relations or Marketing after graduating in 2027. I am a very driven person who appreciates every opportunity that comes my way. Skills such as communication, point-of-sale systems, merchandising, luxury branding, and problem-solving will benefit me throughout my life.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I enjoy working out. I grew up playing field hockey; therefore, being active has always been something I enjoy. I love watching romance TV shows or movies, but I dislike reading.</p>
            <p>I have a brother named Miles, who is 21 and currently works in technology for NBC in Los Angeles. My mother, Debbie, and father, Marc, are by far my favorite people ever. I currently have four animals: two dogs and two cats. This is amusing because I am allergic to cats, and my last name is Katz.</p>
